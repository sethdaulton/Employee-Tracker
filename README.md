# Employee-Tracker

## Description

For this challenge I was tasked with creating an employee tracker. The tracker is designed to respond to  command line prompts. The command line asks a series of questions that the user can respond to. The user can add employees to the database and remove them. They can also add roles, departments, or change the employee role. Lastly, you can also update employee's managers, view employees by manager, view employees by department, delete departments, roles, and employees.
